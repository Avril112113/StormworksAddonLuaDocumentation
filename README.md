# ***Stormworks Addon Lua Documentation***

### **Overview**
GitHub repository containing all of the documentation for Stormworks: Build and Rescue's Addon Lua.

Unfortunately, the documentation is just screenshots of the in-game documentation instead of actual text. However, there is an `intellisense.lua` file containing all Addon Lua functions, types, and callbacks that can provide intellisense (auto-completion, etc) as long as you have the file in your addon workspace and if you have the Lua LSP VSCode extension installed and enabled.

**The documentation can be found in `/docs`.**
